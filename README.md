# Arduino-4WD-Sainsmart-Robot
Arduino controlled 4WD robot

This is the code and files developed for use on my Sainsmart 4WD robot chassis.

I have now broken the code into two variants:

1. Automonymous driving and manual driving via bluetooth
2. Simulated Mars Rover/Robot which accepts commands via serial/bluetooth, feeds the information
back to mission control for distance etc and as well moves as per command but will stop if an obstacle is 
encountered and report back to mission control.
